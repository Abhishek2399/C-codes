The Central government has a reserve stock of nearly 50 lakh vials of the Remdesivir drug and plans production of Tocilizumab drug as part of its expansive preparations for a possible third wave of the Covid-19, top government sources have told News18.  There is also thinking inside the government on reopening the export of Covid-19 vaccines by November once enough supplies of the vaccines is there and a majority of adults are vaccinated in the country. For now, the governmentâ€™s official stand is that its focus is on the domestic vaccination exercise.
Remdesivir and Tocilizumab were crucial drugs for the management of Covid-19 patients during the second wave and a shortage of the same was seen before the government ramped up efforts to produce Remdesivir in the country and import Tocilizumab. The latter is a patented drug of Hoffman La Roche, a Swiss multinational company, which is not manufactured in India and was available through imports.
A top source said the government presently has 50 lakh vials of Remdesivir in stock and has plans for domestic production of Tocilizumab as well in preparation for a possible third wave. The 50 lakh vials of Remdesivir have been kept as a reserve for immediate release to states if the need emerges. News18 has learned that the seven licensed manufacturers of the drug in India now have a monthly capacity of nearly 1.25 crore vials per month and they have produced a total of nearly 3 crore vials so far. Export of Remdesivir could also start soon.
